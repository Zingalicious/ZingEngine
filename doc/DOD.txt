Try to make algorithms self contained and not bouncing through pointers
Keep data needed in succession next to eachother in memory (one array if possible)
	prefetch data to cpu cache

	Network				slow
	File System
	RAM
	RAM Row Banks
	CPU Cache 3
	CPU Cache 2
	CPU Cache 1
	CPU					fast
	
Don't worry about DOD for game logic, some AI (higher levels)
	Mix with OOP
